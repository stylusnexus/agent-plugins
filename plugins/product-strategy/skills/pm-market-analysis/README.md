# pm-market-analysis

This skill should be used when the user asks for Porter's Five Forces, PESTEL or PESTLE, SWOT, market structure, competitive context, or external drivers of product strategy.

Part of the [product-strategy](../../README.md) pack.

## When and how to use it

**Use it when:** You want to understand the market and rivals around your product.

**Try:** `Run a SWOT for my plant tracker, with a source for each point.`

**Skip it when:** You want to choose a strategy. Use pm-strategy for that.

## What it looks like

Example output, invented data (fictional product). Uses the `pm-visuals` SWOT layout: internal versus external, helpful versus harmful.

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---|---|
| Internal | S1 Room schedules already work (31 of 40 beta users use them) | W1 No species care data |
| External | O1 Collector forums are growing (fictional forum stats, 2026) | T1 Phone makers add basic plant reminders (unverified) |

Combinations: S1 + O1 suggests a forum test of shared schedules. W1 + T1 is a risk: test whether collectors need care data at all before building it.

## Install

<details>
<summary>Claude Code (CLI)</summary>

Add the marketplace once, then install the pack:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins
claude plugin install product-strategy@stylus-nexus
```

Inside a session, `/plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins` and `/plugin install product-strategy@stylus-nexus` do the same. This installs the whole product-strategy pack, so pm-canvas, pm-capabilities, pm-discovery, pm-growth, pm-objectives, pm-roadmap, pm-strategy, pm-strategy-fit, pm-teams, pm-value-proposition, pm-vision, pm-visuals, pricing-review and product-manager come with it.

Call it as `/product-strategy:pm-market-analysis`, or let it start on its own when your request matches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code desktop app</summary>

The desktop app's local sessions read the same plugin settings as the CLI, so a pack you installed from the terminal at user scope is already there.

To install from the app, add the marketplace once from a terminal with `claude plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins`. Then, in a local or SSH session on the **Code** tab, click **+** next to the prompt box, choose **Plugins**, then **Add plugin**, and pick **product-strategy**. Plugins do not load in the app's cloud sessions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Codex</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins
codex plugin add product-strategy@stylus-nexus
```

This installs the whole product-strategy pack, so pm-canvas, pm-capabilities, pm-discovery, pm-growth, pm-objectives, pm-roadmap, pm-strategy, pm-strategy-fit, pm-teams, pm-value-proposition, pm-vision, pm-visuals, pricing-review and product-manager come with it. In Codex, type `$` and the skill name (`$product-strategy:pm-market-analysis`), or run `/skills` to pick it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other agents, Skills CLI</summary>

The [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) finds the agents you have and writes the skill into each one's skills folder.

```bash
npx skills add stylusnexus/agent-plugins --skill pm-market-analysis
```

Skills arrive without a pack prefix: `/pm-market-analysis` in most agents and `@pm-market-analysis` in Windsurf. opencode shows `/pm-market-analysis` only when the skill sets an opencode-specific metadata field, and Gemini CLI starts a skill itself after you approve it.

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other agents, by folder</summary>

`.agents/skills` is read by Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, opencode and Windsurf. Claude Code reads `.claude/skills`. Cline does not read `.agents/skills`; use `.cline/skills` or `.claude/skills` there.

Copy the skill folder:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stylusnexus/agent-plugins
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R agent-plugins/plugins/product-strategy/skills/pm-market-analysis .agents/skills/
```

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude app</summary>

1. Turn on **Code execution and file creation** in **Settings > Capabilities**. On Team and Enterprise plans, an owner controls this.
2. Zip the skill folder, so the ZIP holds the `pm-market-analysis` folder:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stylusnexus/agent-plugins
   cd agent-plugins/plugins/product-strategy/skills
   zip -r pm-market-analysis.zip pm-market-analysis
   ```

3. In Claude, open **Customize > Skills**, click **+**, then **+ Create skill**, choose **Upload a skill** and pick `pm-market-analysis.zip`.

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

</details>

<details>
<summary>ChatGPT</summary>

ChatGPT gets this skill through the Codex plugin, which brings the whole product-strategy pack. Run the two Codex commands above, then in ChatGPT type `@` and the skill name.
