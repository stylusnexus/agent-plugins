Part of the [product-strategy](../../README.md) pack.

## When and how to use it

**Use it when:** You must set goals for a quarter and say how you will measure them.

**Try:** `Draft OKRs for next quarter for my plant tracker. Here are my current numbers: [...]`

**Skip it when:** You want a ranked list of features to build.

## What it looks like

Example output, invented data (fictional product). A baseline nobody has measured is marked unknown, not guessed.

| Objective: collectors keep every plant on schedule (Q3) | Type | Baseline | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KR1 Share of active collectors with 2+ rooms set up | outcome | 31 of 40 (beta) | 60% of new users | provisional |
| KR2 Missed waterings per collector per month | outcome | unknown | measure first | instrument by week 2 |
| KR3 Reminder delivered within 1 hour of due time | input | 92% | 99% | provisional |
| Guardrail: notifications turned off within 7 days | guardrail | unknown | no increase | watch |

Review rule: if KR1 is flat after 6 weeks, stop the onboarding bet and investigate.

## Install

<details>
<summary>Claude Code (CLI)</summary>

Add the marketplace once, then install the pack:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins
claude plugin install product-strategy@stylus-nexus
```

Inside a session, `/plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins` and `/plugin install product-strategy@stylus-nexus` do the same. This installs the whole product-strategy pack, so pm-canvas, pm-capabilities, pm-discovery, pm-growth, pm-market-analysis, pm-roadmap, pm-strategy, pm-strategy-fit, pm-teams, pm-value-proposition, pm-vision, pm-visuals, pricing-review and product-manager come with it.

Call it as `/product-strategy:pm-objectives`, or let it start on its own when your request matches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code desktop app</summary>

The desktop app's local sessions read the same plugin settings as the CLI, so a pack you installed from the terminal at user scope is already there.

To install from the app, add the marketplace once from a terminal with `claude plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins`. Then, in a local or SSH session on the **Code** tab, click **+** next to the prompt box, choose **Plugins**, then **Add plugin**, and pick **product-strategy**. Plugins do not load in the app's cloud sessions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Codex</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add stylusnexus/agent-plugins
codex plugin add product-strategy@stylus-nexus
```

This installs the whole product-strategy pack, so pm-canvas, pm-capabilities, pm-discovery, pm-growth, pm-market-analysis, pm-roadmap, pm-strategy, pm-strategy-fit, pm-teams, pm-value-proposition, pm-vision, pm-visuals, pricing-review and product-manager come with it. In Codex, type `$` and the skill name (`$product-strategy:pm-objectives`), or run `/skills` to pick it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other agents, Skills CLI</summary>

The [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) finds the agents you have and writes the skill into each one's skills folder.

```bash
npx skills add stylusnexus/agent-plugins --skill pm-objectives
```

Skills arrive without a pack prefix: `/pm-objectives` in most agents and `@pm-objectives` in Windsurf. opencode shows `/pm-objectives` only when the skill sets an opencode-specific metadata field, and Gemini CLI starts a skill itself after you approve it.

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other agents, by folder</summary>

`.agents/skills` is read by Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, opencode and Windsurf. Claude Code reads `.claude/skills`. Cline does not read `.agents/skills`; use `.cline/skills` or `.claude/skills` there.

Copy the skill folder:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stylusnexus/agent-plugins
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R agent-plugins/plugins/product-strategy/skills/pm-objectives .agents/skills/
```

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude app</summary>

1. Turn on **Code execution and file creation** in **Settings > Capabilities**. On Team and Enterprise plans, an owner controls this.
2. Zip the skill folder, so the ZIP holds the `pm-objectives` folder:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stylusnexus/agent-plugins
   cd agent-plugins/plugins/product-strategy/skills
   zip -r pm-objectives.zip pm-objectives
   ```

3. In Claude, open **Customize > Skills**, click **+**, then **+ Create skill**, choose **Upload a skill** and pick `pm-objectives.zip`.

**Note:** Optional cross-references to other pack skills need the whole pack.

<summary>ChatGPT</summary>

ChatGPT gets this skill through the Codex plugin, which brings the whole product-strategy pack. Run the two Codex commands above, then in ChatGPT type `@` and the skill name.
