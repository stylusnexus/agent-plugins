# Auth Hardening

## Overview

NextAuth v5 (Auth.js) gets the cookie/CSRF/session-signing basics right by default — the actual gap on real projects is almost always **missing per-route authorization checks**, because middleware-level route protection feels like it covers everything and doesn't. Middleware can gate page navigation; it does not gate every API route, server action, and route handler, each of which needs its own explicit check.

## Workflow

1. **Session strategy** — for most products, `strategy: 'jwt'` is the default and fine for stateless scaling on Render. Switch to `strategy: 'database'` (session table via Prisma adapter) only when session revocation needs to be immediate (e.g., "log this user out everywhere right now" for a compromised account) — JWT sessions can't be invalidated server-side before expiry without a denylist.

2. **Cookie flags** — confirm NextAuth's defaults haven't been weakened. In production:
   ```ts
   // auth.ts
   export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
     session: { strategy: 'jwt' },
     useSecureCookies: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Secure flag
     cookies: {
       sessionToken: {
         options: { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'lax', secure: true, path: '/' },
       },
     },
     // ...
   });
   ```
   `httpOnly` and `secure` should never be explicitly disabled. `sameSite: 'lax'` is right for most apps; only use `'none'` (with `secure: true` mandatory) if there's a genuine cross-site embed requirement.

3. **CSRF** — NextAuth v5 handles CSRF tokens automatically for its own sign-in/callback routes. The gap is **custom API routes that mutate state based on session** (e.g., a settings-update route) — these are protected by `SameSite` cookies plus checking `Origin`/`Referer` headers on state-changing requests if the app also accepts cross-origin requests for any reason (public API, webhooks share the route prefix). If there's no legitimate cross-origin use case, same-site cookies alone are sufficient.

4. **OAuth scopes** — request the minimum scope needed, per provider:
   ```ts
   providers: [
     GitHub({
       clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
       clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
       authorization: { params: { scope: 'read:user user:email' } }, // not 'repo', not 'admin:org'
     }),
   ]
   ```
   Audit every configured provider's scope string against what the app actually uses — scope creep (requesting `repo` when only email is needed) is a common finding.

5. **Role checks on every protected route handler** — this is the core of the audit, not middleware:
   ```ts
   // app/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts
   export async function DELETE(req: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
     const session = await auth();
     if (!session?.user) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });

     const campaign = await prisma.campaign.findUnique({ where: { id: params.id } });
     if (!campaign) return new Response('Not found', { status: 404 });
     if (campaign.ownerId !== session.user.id && session.user.role !== 'admin') {
       return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 }); // ownership check, not just "logged in"
     }
     // ... proceed
   }
   ```
   The two failure patterns to grep for: (a) a route that checks `session` exists but never checks the session user actually owns/can-access the specific resource by ID, and (b) a route that relies on the UI simply not rendering a delete button for non-owners — server-side checks are the only ones that count.

6. **Password reset / OTP rate limits** — these endpoints are a favorite target for enumeration and brute force. Confirm a limiter is applied (see [[rate-limit-audit]] for defaults) — at minimum: rate-limit by IP *and* by the target email/phone, and return the same response whether or not the account exists (don't leak account existence via response differences or timing).

7. **Secret rotation** — `AUTH_SECRET` (formerly `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) rotation invalidates all existing JWT sessions immediately (users get logged out) — this is expected and correct behavior after a suspected leak, but confirm the team knows the blast radius before rotating casually. Rotate provider client secrets (GitHub/Google OAuth app secrets) independently on their own suspected-compromise timeline.

8. **Session invalidation on privilege change** — when a user's role changes (promoted to admin, downgraded, banned), a JWT-strategy session keeps its old role claim until the token naturally expires or refreshes. Mitigate by either: keeping JWT `maxAge` short (e.g., 1 hour) with refresh, or checking current role from the database on sensitive actions rather than trusting the JWT claim verbatim, or switching that specific check to a DB lookup:
   ```ts
   const freshUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: session.user.id }, select: { role: true } });
   if (freshUser?.role !== 'admin') return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 });
   ```

## Audit workflow over an existing app

1. Grep every `app/api/**/route.ts` and server action for a call to `auth()` — flag any that mutate/read protected data without one.
2. For each route that has `auth()`, confirm it checks *ownership/role*, not just *presence* of a session.
3. Grep for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`/`AUTH_SECRET` usage — confirm it's read from env, never hardcoded or committed.
4. Check `.env`/`.env.local` are gitignored; check no OAuth client secret appears in any client component or bundled JS (`grep -r "client_secret\|CLIENT_SECRET" app/`, scoped to files that ship to the browser).
5. Test session invalidation manually: change a user's role in the DB, confirm behavior on their next request to a sensitive route (should re-check, per step 8 above).
6. Confirm rate limits on `/api/auth/*` reset/verify flows — reference [[rate-limit-audit]].

## Output / Evidence

Report to Eve as a table: route, session check present (Y/N), ownership/role check present (Y/N), rate limit present (Y/N for auth-adjacent routes). Flag any route missing an ownership check as high-priority regardless of how the rest of the audit goes.

## Stop Conditions

- Found a route with no auth check at all handling user data mutation — flag as a security bug immediately, don't bundle it in with routine findings; confirm with Eve before any public disclosure or fix timeline commitment.
- OAuth client secret found in client-shipped code — stop and treat as a credential leak: rotate the secret at the provider immediately, then fix the code.
- Any place storing plaintext passwords or unhashed reset tokens — stop, this is a fundamental fix, not a hardening tweak.
