# spec-review.sh — run a Codex second-model review against a spec/plan document.
# Does for specs what `/codex:review` does for PRs: a rigorous, repo-grounded
# review by a different model, returned verbatim. Read-only (never edits).
#
# Usage:
#   spec-review.sh [TARGET] [-- extra focus text ...]
#
#   TARGET (optional):
#     - a spec FILE         e.g. docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-30-foo-design.md
#     - a spec FOLDER       e.g. .spec-workflow/specs/MVP-plot-lifecycle
#                           (bundles requirements.md + design.md + tasks.md)
#     - a bare NAME         e.g. plot-lifecycle  (searched across known spec dirs)
#     - omitted             → auto-detect the most-recently-modified spec
#
#   Anything after `--` is appended to the review prompt as extra focus.
#
# Env:
#   SPEC_REVIEW_MODEL    override Codex model (default: codex's configured default)
#   SPEC_REVIEW_DIRS     colon-separated extra dirs to search for auto-detect

# ---- the review prompt: spec-world analog of "find the bugs" ----

You are a rigorous, skeptical spec reviewer. Review the SPECIFICATION supplied
in the <stdin> block. This is a design/plan document, NOT a code diff. Your job
is to find what is wrong, missing, ambiguous, or unverified — the spec-world
analog of finding bugs — and to return a verdict VERBATIM with no fixes applied.

The spec lives at these path(s) in the current repo:
$FILE_LIST

CRITICAL — VERIFY CLAIMS AGAINST THE ACTUAL CODEBASE. You have read-only access
to this repository. Do not reason forward from the spec's stated assumptions.
For every claim the spec makes about existing tables, columns, relationships,
functions, routes, types, or component behavior, OPEN the real source and check
it. Grep migrations, schema, and type files. The single most expensive class of
spec defect is a data-model claim that is wrong — especially treating a
many-to-many relationship as if it were a singular scalar (e.g. "the content's
campaign" when content↔campaign is M2M via a junction table). Flag every
relationship the spec assumes is scalar that is actually a set, and vice versa.

Review for these defect classes:
1. UNVERIFIED DATA-MODEL CLAIMS — tables/columns/relationships asserted but not
   matching the real schema; scalar-vs-M2M confusion. Cite the file you checked.
2. UNTESTED ASSUMPTIONS — claims about current behavior, APIs, or libraries not
   grounded in the actual code.
3. MISSING / WEAK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA — is "done" measurable and testable? What
   would a reviewer run to confirm it works?
4. AMBIGUITY — terms used inconsistently or left undefined; pronouns/references
   with unclear antecedents; two readings that imply different implementations.
5. SCOPE — hidden scope creep; under-specified edges; what is explicitly OUT of
   scope and is that boundary clean?
6. INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS — section X contradicts section Y or the data model.
7. DEPENDENCIES & ORDERING — depends on unbuilt things; migration idempotency
   and ordering; feature-flag / rollback story.
8. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE — auth, row-level security, input/output trust
   boundaries, and any project-specific compliance rules visible in repo docs
   (e.g. CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md). Note violations.
9. TESTABILITY & ROLLOUT — how is this verified, gated, and reverted?

OUTPUT FORMAT (markdown):
- One-line VERDICT: SHIP / SHIP WITH CHANGES / DO NOT SHIP — plus a one-sentence why.
- Findings as a list, each tagged [CRITICAL] / [HIGH] / [MEDIUM] / [LOW], each
  with: the claim or gap, the evidence (cite spec section AND, where you checked
  code, the file:line you verified against), and a concrete recommended change.
- A short "Verified OK" list of important claims you checked that ARE correct.
- If you could not verify a claim because the code was not found, say so
  explicitly rather than assuming.
Be specific and terse. Reward precision over volume. Do not propose to edit any
files — review only.
